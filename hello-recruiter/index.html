As a general rule, I stay at a company for at least a year (although my average is closer to 3 years), so if <a href=/resume>my resume</a> reflects that I have been at my current employer for less than a year it is unlikely that I am interested in a change. With that said, you are always welcome to send me any job roles that you think I would be crazy to pass up. I will always respond to these messages letting you know if they are or are not a good fit.</p><h2 id=what-types-of-roles-interest-me>What types of roles interest me</h2><p>I&rsquo;m interested in working on jobs that:</p><ul><li>utilize Python, TypeScript/JavaScript (particularly node.js, React.js), Go (aka Golang)</li><li>have a focus on spatial or scientific data</li><li>are remote or offer a good work-from-home/flexible-schedule policy</li><li>have a positive/altruistic impact on the world</li><li>contribute to open-source technologies</li><li>are focussed on understanding large datasets, particularly through machine-learning/artificial-intelligence</li><li>include working on distributed systems utilizing microservices via container-based (e.g. Docker) and serverless (e.g. AWS Lambda) technologies</li><li>are full-stack roles</li><li>are working on systems that experience high usage</li><li>are working on systems that serve large amounts of data</li></ul><p>I don&rsquo;t expect any role to touch on all of the above details, however more is better.</p><h2 id=what-types-of-roles-do-not-interest-me>What types of roles do not interest me</h2><p>At this time, I am likely not the right fit for jobs that:</p><ul><li>expect longtime experience with Java, .NET, or PHP.</li><li>require a full-time in-office presence</li><li>require me to relocate</li><li>are temporary contracts</li></ul><p>These are not deal-breakers, however working around these criteria would likely require a very good fit.</p><h2 id=how-to-send-me-a-job-role>How to send me a job role</h2><p>Using the same line-of-communication that you used to initially contact me, please <strong>send me a message with the following information</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Name of company</strong>. If you are unable to name the company, please provide a detailed description of the market in which the company operates and of the product(s) produced by the company.</li><li><strong>Technology stack used</strong></li><li><strong>Salary range</strong></li></ul><p>To save time on both of our parts, <strong>I am only available to schedule a phone conversation after reviewing the above information</strong>. After receiving the above information, I will get back to you shortly with a determination of whether or not the role is the right fit for my current needs.</p><h2 id=my-information>My Information</h2><ul><li>My most up-to-date resume: <a href=https://alukach.com/resume/alukach.pdf>PDF</a>, <a href=https://alukach.com/resume/alukach.html>HTML</a>, <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alukach/alukach.github.io/master/resume/source/alukach.md>TXT</a>, <em>note that I do not offer a Word-based format of my resume</em></li><li>My Github profile: <a href=https://github.com/alukach>@alukach</a></li><li>My LinkedIn account: <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/alukach/>in/alukach</a></li></ul></div></article><footer id=footer><div class=footer-left>Copyright &copy; 2021 Anthony Lukach</div><div class=footer-right><nav><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/posts>Writings</a></li></ul></nav></div></footer></div></body><link rel=stylesheet href=/lib/font-awesome/css/all.min.css><script src=/lib/jquery/jquery.min.js></script><script src=/js/main.js></script></html>
