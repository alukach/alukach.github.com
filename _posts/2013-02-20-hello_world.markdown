I'm just getting things set up with this new blog.  I've been hearing about this movement towards static-generated blogs for a while now, ever since reading [this article](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/) about the Obama Campaign's fundraising platform.  The idea of stepping away from databases and [convulated CMS's](http://www.wordpress.com) and PHP attracted me.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  After seeing how simple the template syntax was (based on [LiquidMarkup](http://liquidmarkup.org/), not unlike [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/) or [Jinja2's](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) syntax), I was sold.  Furthermore, learning that [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages) would post the site for free made it a no-brainer.

So, now this page is up, hosted for free by Github and running a modified version of [Zach Holman's](http://zachholman.com/posts/left/) [Left](https://github.com/holman/left) theme augmented with some pieces from [JekyllBootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
