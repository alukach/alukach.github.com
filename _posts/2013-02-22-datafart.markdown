title: DataFarts - Bad Name, Cool Tool

At last week's [CUGOS][cugos], [Aaron Racicot][racicot] showed off a few cool things that he'd come across over the past month.

One of which was [DataFart](http://www.datafart.com).  Okay, it's a bad name.  A horrible name.  But it's actually a pretty great idea and so easy to set up.  In the site's own words, "DataFart lets you easily graph data from the command line." It's essentially an API end-point to pipe your data to.  It returns a URL which presents your data graphed via [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), turning this:

{% highlight bash linenos=table%}
1.0 2.61 3.1
1.2 2.11 4.8
2.1 3.40 5.2
{% endhighlight %}

into this:

Best off, it's really nothing more than a terminal command:

{% highlight bash %}
cat somedata.txt | curl --data-binary @- datafart.com
{% endhighlight %}

_Installation_, so-to-speak, is nothing more than an alias in your `.bash_profile`:

{% highlight bash %}
alias datafart='curl --data-binary @- datafart.com'
{% endhighlight %}

For extra points, I append the command with `xargs open` (for Mac OS) or `xargs gnome-open` (for Ubuntu) to have the returned URL automatically open in your default browser:
{% highlight bash %}
alias datafart='curl --data-binary @- datafart.com | xargs open'
{% endhighlight %}
