# Hello.

<br />

I'm a GIS Developer / Cartographer / Pythonista / Open Source celebrant from the Northwest of the United States.  I'm currently employed with [OspreyInformatics][osprey], a Calgary-based startup.  While my professional background lies mainly with ocean data, I'm a lover of all types of spatial data.  I maintain and occasionally develop the [LivingCityMap][lcm], an to effort spatially index all things happening in Seattle, Portland, and elswhere.  I get my fix of what's new and fresh from Seattle's so-very-active OSGeo chapter, [CUGOS][cugos].

When I'm not writing code, you can typically find me walking my dog in Calgary AB, making curries, or riding my bike.

This blog is primarily intended to be a place for me to post small tips and tricks that I come across while working on projects.  Topics will typically revolved around Open Source tools and the Unix toolchain.  Occasionally, I'll go into greater depth about tools and methods that I am experimenting with at any given time.  At any rate, I hope that it's as useful for you as it is for me.
