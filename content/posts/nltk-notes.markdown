title: Natural Language Toolkit Notes
category: posts
tags: [nltk, python]

I've been experimenting with Python's [Natural Language Toolkit](http://nltk.org/), following along with Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper's book ["Natural Language Processing with Python --- Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit"](http://nltk.org/book/) (_[pdf version](http://it-ebooks.info/book/261/)_).  

So far, the book's been great.  As I'm going through the book, I've been writing down notes relating to the book's examples.  I've made a Github repo to store these notes and experiments that I may be doing using the NLTK [here](https://github.com/alukach/nltk-experiments).
