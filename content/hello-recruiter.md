Thanks for reaching out. You likely received a link to this page from me in response to a message you sent me via email or LinkedIn. Unfortunately, I am unable to schedule phone calls with every recruiter that contacts me. For this reason I have created this page that should help streamline our communication. It aims to answer common questions you may have and to outline criteria so that we can quickly identify if I am the right person for the role you're looking to fill.

## Am I currently looking for a new job?

No, I am **not actively looking** for a new position (I will remove this sentence if that changes). As a general rule, I stay at a company for at least a year (although my average is closer to 3 years), so if [my resume](/resume) reflects that I have been at my current employer for less than a year it is unlikely that I am interested in a change. With that said, **you are always welcome to send me any job roles** that you think I would be crazy to pass up. I will always respond to these messages letting you know if they are or are not a good fit.

## What types of roles interest me

I'm interested in working on jobs that:

- utilize **Python, TypeScript/JavaScript (particularly node.js, React.js)**. I'm eager to move towards Go (aka Golang) or Rust however I have only minor experience with either.
- have a focus on **spatial** or **scientific data**
- are **remote** or offer a good work-from-home/flexible-schedule policy
- have a **positive/altruistic impact** on the world
- contribute to **open-source technologies**
- are focussed on understanding **large datasets**, particularly through machine-learning/artificial-intelligence
- include working on **distributed systems** utilizing microservices via container-based (e.g. Docker) and serverless (e.g. AWS Lambda) technologies
- are **full-stack** roles
- are working on systems that experience **high usage**
- are working on systems that serve **large amounts of data**

I don't expect any role to touch on all of the above details, however more is better.

## What types of roles do not interest me

At this time, I am likely not the right fit for jobs that:

- expect longtime experience with Java, .NET, or PHP.
- require a full-time in-office presence
- require me to relocate
- are temporary contracts

These are not deal-breakers, however working around these criteria would likely require a very good fit.

## How to send me a job role

Using the same line-of-communication that you used to initially contact me, please **send me a message with the following information**:

- **Name of company**. If you are unable to name the company, please provide a detailed description of the market in which the company operates and of the product(s) produced by the company.
- **Technology stack used**
- **Salary range**

To save time on both of our parts, **I am only available to schedule a phone conversation after reviewing the above information**. After receiving the above information, I will get back to you shortly with a determination of whether or not the role is the right fit for my current needs.
