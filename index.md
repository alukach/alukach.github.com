## Welcome to my little part of the internet.

I'm a GIS Developer / Cartographer / Hydrographer / Open Source celebrant from the Northwest of the United States.  I'm currently employed with [OneOcean Corporation](http://www.oneoceancorporation.com), a Seattle-based ocean data startup.  While my professional background lies mainly with ocean data, I'm a lover of all types of spatial data.  I maintain and occasionally develop the [LivingCityMap](http://www.livingcitymap.com), an effort spatially index all things happening in Seattle's events.  I get my fix of what's new and fresh from Seattle's so-very-active OSGeo chapter, [CUGOS](http://www.cugos.org).

When I'm not in my nerd-cave or at work, you can typically find me walking my dog on a beach in Victoria BC, making curries, or riding my bike.

This blog is primarily intended to be a place for me to post small tips and tricks that I come across while working on projects.  Topics will typically revolved around Open Source tools and the Unix toolchain.  Occasionally, I'll go into greater depth about tools and methods that I am experimenting with at any given time.  At any rate, I hope that it's as useful for you as it is for me.
